=head1 NAME

Lingua::EN::PluralToSingular - change an English plural to a singular

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lingua::EN::PluralToSingular 'to_singular';

    print to_singular ('knives');
    # "knife"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl module converts words denoting a plural in the English
language into words denoting a singular noun.

=head1 ROUTINES

=head2 to_singular

    my $singular = to_singular ($word);

Convert C<$word> into its singular form. For example,

    to_singular ('cats')

returns 'cat'. If the word is unknown or does not seem to be
plural, C<to_singular> returns the word itself, so

    to_singular ('battlehorn');

returns 'battlehorn'.

=head3 Limitations

It assumes its input is a noun. For example, "lives" may be the plural
of "life", or the verb "live", as in "he lives". The routine assumes a
noun and converts to "life".

It does not deal with capitalized words. If the input word may be
capitalized, or if its initial letter may be capitalized, the user
must preprocess it to put it into the normal case. So, for example,

    to_singular ('FLIES');

returns 'FLIES' and

    to_singular ('Wolves');

returns 'Wolve'.
